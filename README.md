# Hospital Readmission Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes hospital readmission data to identify key factors contributing to patient readmissions. Using data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, we uncover patterns that can help improve patient care and reduce unnecessary hospital stays. The final deliverables include a structured dataset, insights and recommendations.

## Case Study
### **Background**
Hospital readmissions are a significant concern in healthcare, often indicating inadequate patient recovery or gaps in post-discharge care. This study investigates patterns in hospital readmissions using patient data.

### **Objective**
To analyze hospital readmission trends and determine the key factors influencing readmissions.

### **Methodology**
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, standardized data types, and removed inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified trends in patient stay duration.
   - Analyzed readmission rates by different factors (age, admission type, and discharge disposition).
   - Visualized correlations between variables.
3. **Insights & Recommendations**:
   - Older patients tend to have longer hospital stays.
   - Certain admission types correlate with higher readmission rates.
   - Patients discharged to home healthcare services have lower readmission rates compared to those without follow-up care.

### **Key Findings**
- Readmission rates are influenced by admission source and discharge type.
- Patients aged 80-90 have the highest hospital stay duration.
- Follow-up care can significantly reduce readmissions.

### **Recommendations**
- Implement targeted post-discharge programs for high-risk patients.
- Increase follow-up interventions for patients discharged under high readmission risk categories.
- Optimize hospital resource allocation based on readmission trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Git & GitHub** (Version Control)
